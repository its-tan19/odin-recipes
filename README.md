# My Recipe Website

This project is a simple, static recipe website built entirely with HTML. It consists of a homepage linking to individual recipe pages that display images, descriptions, ingredients, and step-by-step instructions for each dish. The focus of this project was to master the fundamentals of HTML structure without relying on additional styling.

## Self Reflection

Working on this project has been a rewarding experience that solidified my understanding of HTML and the structure of web pages. I learned how to organize content effectively, create clear navigation between pages, and maintain a clean codebase. This project not only enhanced my technical skills but also boosted my confidence to take on more complex projects involving CSS and JavaScript in the future. I'm proud of the progress I've made and excited to continue growing as a web developer.

Thank you for checking out my project!
